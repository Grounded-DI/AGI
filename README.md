# AGI – Artificial General Intelligence (DI-AGI)

DI-AGI is a sealed AGI construct built on deterministic logic — not predictive guesswork.

This repository contains the core documentation for the DIAGI system, including the AGI declaration, vault metadata, and system alignment under AGDI 9.9 governance.

## 🔐 What Makes DI-AGI Different

- Built on **Protocol A**, with scroll-bound logic
- Governed by **AGDI 9.9** – Deterministic Governance Infrastructure
- Aligned through **DIA Jr. + AGIA Jr.** for tone, integrity, and resonance
- Outputs are logic-traced, non-hallucinatory, and mimic-proof
